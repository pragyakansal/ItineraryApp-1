# ItineraryApp

Welcome to the COMP 322 ItineraryApp!

As of now, there are a few things you must do to ensure proper functinoality of the whole program. This is due to a repo configuration that does not
import node_modules.

Please install the following in /ItineraryApp/ItineraryApp
  If not, the program may not function as intended.
  
  1) npm install
  2) npm install react-native-paper@5.0.0-rc.10
  3) npm install react-native-google-places-autocomplete --save
